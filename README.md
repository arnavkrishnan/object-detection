# Object Detection

This repository contains an object detection app built using Google Colaboratory. The app uses pre-trained models to detect objects in images.

## Files
- There is only one file, which is a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb). It contains text, code snippets (some of which are useful and some are not).

## Setup

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook

2. Open it in your editor of choice; I like to use Google Colaboratory but there are other options out there.
Google Colab allows for easy integration with your google account, and also allows you to easily put your iPythonNotebook on Github

4. Replace secrets. I have secrets for my ngrok authtoken and ngrok website (yes, I know the website isn't neccesary, I was just trying to learn how it works)
You can sign up [here]([url](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)). And [here's]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPa51KxqUAw)) a useful video for using secrets in Google Colab.

6. Run the code & launch your website. _Not all of the code in the notebook should be run! Sorry - I just didn't have time to sift through it_.
I would say first try to figure out which code snippets are useful yourself, or ask an AI like ChatGPT.
If you can't, don't hesitate to message me on github ðŸ˜Š.

## Dependencies
There is no "requirements.txt" or anything for this. Just make sure to run all the inputs in Google Colab.

## Deployment
At the bottom of the notebook there is a launch_website() function. Run that and it should print out your url
